Let's add life to your online store with a beautiful product slider!
 
== Description ==

### Create Your Slider

Select from all of your product categories *(the empties will not appear)* and
limit the products shown in the loop.

### No need to Worry in Smartphones

WPC was build with a mobile 1st design from start, so you'll not have 
any problems of compatibility with the sliders in mobile.

By resizing and adding some styles in the scrollbar:
we could make something that fit the style we wanted to the plugin.
Now we do recommend that you put more than 5 products to show in the desktop

By adding the last update, we focused in founding a card size that would fit great 5 products in the loop for a minimum 1024px width resolution. With this, we upgraded the photo size to 190px and now it all fits great.
