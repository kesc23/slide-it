Select from all of your product categories *(the empties will not appear)* and
limit the products shown in the loop.

##### No need to Worry in Smartphones

WPC was build with a mobile 1st design from start, so you'll not have 
any problems of compatibility with the sliders in mobile.

- deleted wpc_loop_elementor.css as it is not needed anymore;
